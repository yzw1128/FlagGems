# FlagGems Overview

## About FlagGems

*FlagGems* is a high-performance general operator library implemented
in the [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) language.
It aims to provide a suite of kernel functions to accelerate LLM training and inference.

By registering with the ATen backend of PyTorch, *FlagGems* facilitates a seamless transition,
allowing users to switch to the Triton function library without the need to modify their model code.

FlagGems is supported by the OpenAI Triton compiler (for NVIDIA and AMD) and
[FlagTree compiler](https://github.com/flagos-ai/flagtree/) for different AI hardware platforms.
Users can continue to use the ATen backend as usual while enjoying significant performance enhancement.
The Triton language offers benefits in readability, user-friendliness and performance comparable to CUDA.
This convenience allows developers to engage in the development of *FlagGems* with minimal learning effort.
