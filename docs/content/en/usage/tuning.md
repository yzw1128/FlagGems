# Achieving Optimal Performance with FlagGems

While *FlagGems* kernels are designed for high performance usage scenarios,
achieving optimal end-to-end speed in full model deployments still demands
for careful integration and consideration of the system's runtime behavior.
In particular, two common performance bottlenecks are:

- *Runtime autotuning overhead* in production environments.
- *Sub-optimal dispatching* due to the framework-level kernel registration and/or
  the interaction with the Triton runtime.

These issues can occasionally offset the benefits of highly optimized kernels.
To address them, we provide two complementary optimization paths designed to ensure that
*FlagGems* operates at peak efficiency in real inference scenarios.

## Pre-tuning model shapes for inference scenarios

*FlagGems* provides [`LibTuner`](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems/blob/v4.2.0/src/flag_gems/utils/libentry.py#L206),
a lightweight enhancement to the auto-tuning system in Triton.
`LibTuner` introduces a **persistent, per-device tuning cache** that
helps mitigate some runtime overhead in the default auto-tuning process in Triton.

### How LibTuner works?

Triton typically performs auto-tuning during the first few executions of a new input shape,
which may cause latency spikes — especially in latency-sensitive inference systems.
`LibTuner` addresses this with:

- **Persistent caching**: Best auto-tuning configurations are persisted across runs.
- **Cross-process sharing**: The tuning cache is shared across processes on the same device.
- **Reduced runtime overhead**: Once tuned, operators will skip the tuning step in future runs.

This is particularly useful for operators like `mm` and `addmm`,
which often trigger the auto-tuning logic in Triton.

### How to Use Pre-tuning

To proactively warm up your system in order to populate the tuning cache:

{{% steps %}}
1. Identify key input shapes used in your production workload.
1. Run the pre-tuning script to benchmark and cache best configs.
   You can run `python examples/pretune.py` as an example.
1. Deploy normally, and *FlagGems* will automatically pick the optimal config
   from cache during inference.

> **Tips**
>
> - The `pretune.py` script accepts example shapes and workloads which can be used
>   to simulate your model's actual use cases. You can customize it for batch sizes,
>   sequence lengths, etc.
> - In frameworks like **vLLM** (`v0.8.5+`), adding `--compile-mode` to the command line
>   will automatically initiate a warmup step.
>   If *FlagGems*  is enabled, this flag also triggers `LibTuner`-based pre-tuning implicitly.

refer to the [`examples/pretune.py`](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems/blob/v4.2.0/examples/pretune.py)
as an example.
