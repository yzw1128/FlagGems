    TileBenchmark designed to evaluate tensor repeat operations along specified dimensions.
    Due to potential memory limitations, benchmark sizes need to be carefully controlled.

    Notably, when the input size is set to (1024, 1024, 1024) and the repeat dimensions
    are set to [1, 1, 2], the system encountered an "illegal memory access" error.
    To avoid such issues, we constrain the benchmark input sizes for these operations
    to prevent excessive memory usage.
